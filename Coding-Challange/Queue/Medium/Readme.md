8-Explain priority queues and their applications.

_answer_
A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority associated with it. Instead of following the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle like a normal queue, elements in a priority queue are dequeued based on their priority.

Higher priority elements are dequeued first.
If two elements have the same priority, they are dequeued based on their insertion order.

Types of Priority Queues

Max Priority Queue
The element with the highest priority is dequeued first.
Example: Processing highest priority tasks first.

Min Priority Queue
The element with the lowest priority is dequeued first.
Example: Shortest job scheduling in operating systems.

Applications of Priority Queues

1. Operating Systems (Process Scheduling)
   CPU scheduling algorithms like Shortest Job Next (SJN) and Priority Scheduling use priority queues to determine which process to execute next.

2. Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra & A)_
   Dijkstra's Algorithm and A Search Algorithm_ use a min priority queue to determine the next node with the shortest path.

3. Data Compression (Huffman Coding)
   Huffman Coding, used in file compression algorithms (ZIP, PNG, MP3), constructs a Huffman Tree using a priority queue.

4. Network Routing (Packet Scheduling)
   Network devices prioritize packets with higher importance (e.g., emergency messages in VoIP).

5. AI and Machine Learning (Task Scheduling)
   AI decision-making models use priority queues to process more relevant data first.

6. Event-Driven Simulations
   Simulations (like bank teller systems or flight booking systems) use priority queues to process high-priority events first.

7. Load Balancing in Web Servers
   High-priority requests (like real-time updates) get processed first in web server queues.
