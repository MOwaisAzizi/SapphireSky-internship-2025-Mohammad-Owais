1-What is a stack, and how does it follow the LIFO principle?
_answer_
A stack is a data structure that follows a specific order for adding and removing elements. It operates on the LIFO principle, which stands for Last In, First Out. This means that the most recently added element (the last one) is the first one to be removed.

Key characteristics of a stack:
Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: This operation removes the element from the top of the stack.
Peek (or Top): This operation allows you to look at the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
IsEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty.

2-Explain the purpose of push() and pop() in a stack
_answer_
push():
The push() operation is used to add an item to the top of the stack. When you push an element, it is placed on the top, becoming the new "top" element of the stack.

pop():
The pop() operation is used to remove and return the top item from the stack. After popping an element, the next element in the stack becomes the new top.
