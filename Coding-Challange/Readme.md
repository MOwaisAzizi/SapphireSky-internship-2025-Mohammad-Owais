1-What is a stack, and how does it follow the LIFO principle?
*answer*
A stack is a data structure that follows a specific order for adding and removing elements. It operates on the LIFO principle, which stands for Last In, First Out. This means that the most recently added element (the last one) is the first one to be removed.

Key characteristics of a stack:
Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: This operation removes the element from the top of the stack.
Peek (or Top): This operation allows you to look at the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
IsEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty.
