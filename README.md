1-Four Pillars of OOP

***answer***
Encapsulation: Bundling variables and methods that operate on the data into a single unit and restrict direct access to details.

Abstraction: Hidding complex implementation details and exposing only the neccessary parts of an object.

inheritance : Allowing a class(child) to inherit properties and methods from another class(parent)

polymorphism : The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, usually through method overriding.
